# Assignment 1

The task this week is to implement a client application capable of sending a http get request to a provided service, implemented in any programming language you like.

## To Run

Install requirements with `stack build`, then `stack solver`

Then run `stack ghci` and then run `client`. Make sure to have the server running on 127.0.0.1:8000, as this is what it expects.
It will ask you to input a string, do so, then hit enter, then hit enter again to display the response, hit enter again to quit.
